Some of the key highlights include:

1) **Shopping Cart**<br>
   This includes updating the number in the navbar when a new type of product is added or removed, updating the quantity and price and checkout form.<br>

2) **Filtering Products**<br>
   Users can filter by grade, subjects, and product types. Users can use one category, or all three. By clicking on the reset button, all products will re-appear on the right-hand side<br>

4) **Changing Quantities**<br>
   Users can adjust the quantity of a product using an incrementor and decrementor button. This dynamically changes the quantity<br>
5) **Using product id from the url to data-bind an individual product's details.** <br>
   Users can click on the title or thumbnail to view more about an individual product. The HTML was coded once, and used angular directive *ngFor to populate the appropriate product details<br>

6) **Reactive Forms**<br>
   Reactive forms were used in the contact us page, filtering form, and checkout page. A combination of communicating with the backend using Sequelize, and console log were used.<br>
